        "reasoning": "The technical BUY signal is strongly supported by fundamental catalysts. JSW Steel reported a massive 307% YoY surge in consolidated Net Profit (₹1,646 Cr) for Q2 FY26, driven by record crude steel production (7.90 MT) and robust domestic demand. While global steel markets remain muted, India's steel demand is projected to grow at 8-9% annually through 2025-2026, fueled by government infrastructure spending. Additionally, the potential imposition of safeguard duties on steel imports serves as a significant regulatory tailwind to protect margins.",
        "fundamental_summary": "JSW Steel is capitalizing on India's infrastructure boom, delivering record production volumes (7.90 MT in Q2). Despite global headwinds, the company achieved a 12% YoY revenue growth and a sharp profitability turnaround (PAT +307% YoY). Valuation is elevated (PE ~45x) but justified by the high-growth phase and capacity expansion plans (targeting 50 MTPA). Operational efficiencies and lower raw material costs are aiding margin recovery.",

However, the company maintains a strong balance sheet with Net Debt/EBITDA ~1.48x, the best among peers.

        "reasoning": "The technical Golden Cross (50/200 EMA) is supported by a fundamental turnaround story. In Q2 FY26 (reported Oct 2025), NMDC Steel significantly narrowed its net loss to ₹115 Cr (from ₹595 Cr YoY) and doubled its hot metal production to 2 MT, indicating the Nagarnar plant is successfully ramping up. While privatization remains delayed (as of mid-2025 reports), the stock trades at a deep discount to the plant's replacement cost (~0.6x). Domestic steel demand growth of 8-9% and potential safeguard duties on imports provide a favorable macro backdrop to support the technical breakout.",
        "fundamental_summary": "NMDC Steel is in a critical ramp-up phase, achieving record production volumes in Q2 FY26 which aided in slashing net losses by ~80% YoY. Although EBITDA margins (~6%) are currently pressured by soft global steel prices, the company is approaching breakeven.

Technically, the stock is in a 'Strong Sell' zone with a confirmed EMA 50/200 Death Cross and negative momentum indicators (RSI/MACD). Fundamentally, recent Q2 FY26 earnings (referenced in Dec 2025 data) indicate financial strain with a reported loss (PAT ~-32 Cr) and contracting margins, a sharp reversal from the previous year's growth. High interest costs and a broader sell-off in the EMS sector (impacting peers like Dixon and Kaynes) further weigh on the stock.",

Latest financial data for the quarter ended September 2025 (Q2 FY26) reveals operational challenges, with the company reporting a consolidated loss and a sharp decline in PBT due to increased interest burdens and margin compression.

        "reasoning": "Radico Khaitan is demonstrating exceptional fundamental momentum with Q2 net profit soaring ~73% YoY to ₹140 Cr, driven by a 21.7% volume growth in the high-margin 'Prestige & Above' segment. The technical signal at 3325 aligns with a breakout attempt near all-time highs (resistance zone ₹3300-3350). With brokerage targets revised upwards to ₹3500-3800 and the stock trading above key moving averages (20/50 DMA), the setup is supported by both earnings growth and sector tailwinds (wedding/festive season demand).",
        "fundamental_summary": "In the recent Q2 FY26 (Sep 2025) results, Radico reported consolidated revenue growth of ~29% YoY to ₹5,056 Cr and a PAT jump of 73% to ₹140 Cr. The company's strategy of premiumization is yielding expanded margins, with 'Prestige & Above' brands now contributing significantly to volume growth. Despite high valuations (PE >90x), the PEG ratio is becoming attractive due to the high earnings growth velocity.",
