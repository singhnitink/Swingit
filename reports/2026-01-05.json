The sharp reduction in promoter stake (down to ~23.8%) has dampened sentiment, raising concerns about long-term conviction.

Despite a 6-month correction (~15% decline YoY), IRFC is trading near a strong support zone (120-126). Fundamentals remain robust with the company recently achieving its FY26 sanction target of ₹60,000 Cr early (by Q3 end) and securing an 'Excellent' DPE rating for the 5th consecutive year (Jan 2026). The upcoming Union Budget (Feb 1, 2026) acts as a primary catalyst, as railway capex is expected to remain high (>₹2.5 Lakh Cr). The stock is oversold, and the CE+QQE signal likely captures this momentum shift.",
        "fundamental_summary": "IRFC continues to demonstrate financial discipline, evidenced by its 'Excellent' DPE rating and improved Debt-to-Equity ratio. While revenue growth has been tepid (~2% YoY in recent quarters), the company provides stability with a dividend yield of ~1.3% and zero NPAs. It has successfully met its annual sanction targets for FY26 ahead of schedule, ensuring revenue visibility. The stock trades at a reasonable valuation relative to its historical high, making it attractive ahead of the government's infrastructure spending announcements.",
