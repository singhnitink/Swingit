This news has triggered a breakout to fresh 52-week highs (~429 INR), overriding concerns about weak Q2 FY26 earnings (-30% profit) and high domestic inventory. While domestic offtake dipped 5.2% in Dec 2025, the new export channel is viewed as a solution to the supply glut. Additionally, an upcoming Q3 dividend (historically declared in late Jan) provides yield support.",
        "fundamental_summary": "Q2 FY26 net profit declined 30% YoY to ₹4,354 Cr due to lower e-auction premiums, though production is recovering (+4.6% in Dec 2025). The key driver is the strategic pivot to exports to clear record-high pithead inventory. Dividend yield remains attractive at ~6%.",

The current price of 352.10 confirms a breakout above the recent consolidation range (335-345 INR).

However, the company continues to aggressively expand, with group installed capacity rising to ~84 GW.

Reports indicate the government is unlikely to proceed with the disinvestment of NMDC Steel in the current fiscal year (FY26), removing the primary catalyst for the stock's valuation premium. Additionally, while revenue has grown due to the Nagarnar plant ramp-up, the company remains loss-making at the net level (reducing losses but not profitable). The technical setup involves a 'Death Cross' (50 EMA below 200 EMA), and the recent price bounce to 45 INR likely represents a 'retest' of resistance or a bull trap, offering a favorable risk-reward for short entry.",
        "fundamental_summary": "NMDC Steel's financials show significant revenue growth (up ~179% YoY) as the Nagarnar plant stabilizes, yet the company continues to report net losses. The stock's primary investment thesis was the government's strategic disinvestment (privatization), which sources suggest is now delayed beyond FY26 due to operational and political roadblocks.
