Despite reporting strong Q2 FY26 earnings (Net Profit +39% YoY), the stock has faced 'Sell on News' pressure and was recently downgraded to 'SELL' by major analysts (e.g., MarketsMojo) due to expensive valuations (P/B ~2x) and deteriorating momentum. Technicals show a breakdown below key moving averages (20, 50, 200 DMA) with the Supertrend flipping bearish. Fundamentally, while production is rising, the projected 18% surge in sugar output for the 2025-26 season has triggered fears of an oversupply glut and falling realization rates, weighing heavily on sentiment despite the MSP hike pleas.",

Fundamentally, the massive adverse arbitration award of ~$490 million (approx. ₹4,100 Crore) reported in late 2025 acts as a severe catalyst for downside, potentially eroding a significant portion of annual profits. Institutional sentiment has turned cautious with rating downgrades.",
