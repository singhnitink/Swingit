        "reasoning": "The technical BUY signal (Supertrend Flip) aligns with a fundamental recovery narrative. After correcting from its Jan 2025 all-time highs (~2402), Lupin is regaining momentum in Jan 2026, supported by strong Q2 FY26 earnings and analyst upgrades (targets raised to ₹2400-₹2600 in late 2025). While recent FDA observations (Form 483 at Goa and Nagpur in late 2025) present a risk, the market appears to have priced this in, focusing instead on margin expansion and the GLP-1 opportunity. Valuation remains reasonable (PE ~22x) compared to historical averages.",
        "fundamental_summary": "Lupin continues to demonstrate growth in its US and India businesses, with significant margin improvement reported in recent quarters. Key positives include the exclusive GLP-1 partnership with Gan & Lee and zero FDA observations at its Pune Bioresearch facility.

        "fundamental_summary": "Metropolis Healthcare shows accelerating growth with Q2 FY26 Revenue at ₹429 Cr (+22.7% YoY) and PAT at ₹53 Cr (+13.3% YoY). The company is debt-free with a cash surplus. Growth is fueled by volume expansion (Patient volume +11%) and strategic acquisitions (DAPIC, Dr. RS Patil). EBITDA margins remain healthy at ~25%, though slightly compressed due to expansion costs. Valuation (PE ~69x) is premium but justified by >20% top-line growth.",
