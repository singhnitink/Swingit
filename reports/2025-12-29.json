Despite the prompt's 'US Market' constraint, the ticker and price data explicitly match the Indian entity (INR currency). The SELL signal is validated by both technical and fundamental factors. Fundamentally, the company reported a 3% YoY revenue decline in Q2 due to supply chain disruptions (fire at a contract manufacturer) and seasonal headwinds. Technical indicators (Moving Averages, MACD) on the daily chart signal a 'Strong Sell' trend, with the price recently breaking down below key support at 2600. The proposed Stop Loss (2598) is well-placed above this broken support and the 50-day EMA.",
